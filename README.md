#  **VIATAB** - The VIA Tabloid Application
The main focus of the course assignment is on building a VIA tabloid application that adds sensational stories, reads, updates, and deletes stories from different departments here in Horsens, following **DevOps** practices.

To make the design and technology decisions in the course more concrete, it is expected that you will implement an example application called the VIA Tabloid application. This application will be implemented incrementally throughout the course.

The VIA-Tabloid application is a web application that displays captions of sensational stories from different departments (at least 3) in VIA. The department where the respective stories/ideas are displayed could be placed on the page using different components or on different tabs.

The application should have at least three components:
- **Frontend** (React, TypeScript)
- **Backend** (Java Spring Boot or C# .NET)
- **Database** (PostgreSQL or MySQL, MongoDB)
  
A working frontend is required for this app and should implement the features for your tabloid app; add story item, delete item, etc. It does not need to be especially pretty, but there needs to be a frontend that connects with a backend, server, etc. You can use React or any frontend framework you like, but again, it must have a real connection to your backend. We will not be particular on how the frontend looks; rather, the use of DevOps throughout the assignment.
